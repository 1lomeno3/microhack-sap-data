# 6 - Take Actions in the SAP system

[< 5 Create Alerting Rule](./CreateAlertingRule.md) - **[üè†Home](./README.md)**

As a final step we want to take actions with the information that we saw in the Power BI Dashboard. 
Thanks to the ML and alerting functionality we can easily identify payers, whose payment is typically delayed. In order to flag them in the SAP system (as "bad payers") we want to add a feature to our Power BI Dashboards that quickly can flag such a customer as a "bad payer" in the SAP system.

For this we have created a simple Power Automate flow that calls the OData service to update the Business Partner role from "Customer" to "Bad Payer Customer".

## Import Power Automate Flow

* Open [https://flow.microsoft.com/](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and click on `My Flows` -> `Import` to import the preconfigued Power Automate Flow that updates the Business Partner Role
